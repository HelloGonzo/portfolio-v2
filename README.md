## Description

This was a really fun project to work on. I was able to experiment with design, and use a lot of cool CSS features I'd been wanting to try. Some of my favorite features:

### Floating Elements:

The shapes were some of the most frustrating elements of the whole project, but I knew it would look great if I could pull it off. Each element is absolutely positioned, with most values using `clamp` to make the overall layout as responsive as possible.

### Parallax Scrolling:

As soon as I had the concept for the floating shapes, I knew I needed to add more dimension to them and create a feeling of space. I used CSS's `transform-style: preserve-3d`, and played around with the z-indexes and scale of the elements. It was a fun challenge, and I'm super proud of how it came out.
